# Artic App

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
## Introduction

Artic is an iOS app for artists to share photos and videos. This app allows artists to share their creative work for other people to see and discover. 
Users will be able to browse various visual arts, leave likes and comments, as well as follow their favourite artists.
1b Aim to develop this application

<!-- GOAL -->
## Goal

The main goal of this project is to improve my app development skills and learn iOS programming using Xcode as an IDE and Objective C as a language. 
The idea for this app is a sort of a simplified "Instagram for artists". Simplified as my skills and knowledge with this IDE and language are limited 
at the time I'm developing it. I was inspired by other social media platforms where artists share their work, and as both consumer and creator of art, 
I wanted to try making one as a developer
